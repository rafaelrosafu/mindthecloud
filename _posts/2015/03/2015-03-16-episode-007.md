Hello everybody,

Today we're going to share interviews with 2 indie game companies incubated at [Execution Labs](http://executionlabs.com/) in Montreal: PouPou with Andy and Norsfell with Julian Maroda and RÃ©gis Cajet (I interviwed the latter in French so I didn't add the audio). We'll talk about their games and how they use cloud services to create or deliver them.

Feedback, corrections and suggestions are welcome. Leave them bellow or reach us on [@_MindTheCloud](https://twitter.com/_MindTheCloud) or [@dtsato](https://twitter.com/dtsato) or [@rafaelrosafu](https://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu) or *contact@mindthecloud.com*.

Have fun and Mind the Cloud.
