Salve,

DevOps is all the rage nowadays, but how do regular companies understand it and what do they need to change to benefit from it?

Today we talk with **[Danilo Sato](https://twitter.com/dtsato)**, consultant at [Thoughtworks](http://www.thoughtworks.com/?utm_source=mindthecloud), devops practitioner and author, to start talking about this huge subject. We'll also discuss the subject from the previous episode, immutable infrastructure, and we have a small surprise for you.

Feedback, corrections and suggestions are welcome. Leave them bellow or reach me on [@rafaelrosafu](https://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu) or *contact@mindthecloud.com*.

Have fun and Mind the Cloud.
