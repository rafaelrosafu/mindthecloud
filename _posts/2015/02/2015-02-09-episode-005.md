Salve,

Today we talk with **[Mathieu Martin](https://twitter.com/webmat)** from [Lightspeed](http://www.lightspeedpos.com/), they develop POS (point of sale) software that's used around the world and handle more than US$9 billion in transactions per year.

In this first episode, we'll talk about their organization and culture, and how that matches the use of cloud and devops.

Feedback, corrections and suggestions are welcome. Leave them bellow or reach us on [@_MindTheCloud](https://twitter.com/_MindTheCloud) or [@dtsato](https://twitter.com/dtsato) or [@rafaelrosafu](https://twitter.com/rafaelrosafu) or *contact@mindthecloud.com*.
